# Duplicate-question-detection-using-deep-learning
Detecting semantic similarity and equivalence in sentences has many applications in

natural language understanding, ranging from paraphrase identification to evaluat-
ing machine translation. Traditional natural language processing techniques such as

shingling have been found to have limited success in separating related question from
duplicate questions. Duplicate question detection is a special case of the more general
problem of question-question similarity. Identifying two questions as duplicates can
be challenging because the choice of words, structure of sentences, and even context,

can vary significantly between questions, even if the intended semantics are near iden-
tical. In this project the problem of detecting duplicate questions is addressed, which

is an important step towards automating the process of answering new questions.
As finding and annotating such potential duplicates manually is very tedious and
costly, automatic methods based on machine learning are a viable alternative. Using
a dataset of labeled question pairs provided by question-and-answer forum Quora,
I explored deep learning methodologies for detecting duplicate question pairs using
long short-term memory networks (LSTMs).
